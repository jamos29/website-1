  <h2>Mowachaht/Muchalaht</h2>
  <p> The Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations are a First Nations government on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
    The Nations centre is known as Yuquot, which means “Friendly Cove,” and it is located on Nootka Island.
    It has historically allowed multiple tribes to gather during the summer harvesting season as one large confederacy
    of strength, commerce and hospitality. To this day, Mowachaht/Muchalaht still continues with the opening up the
     Yuquot Historic Village site for the entire world to see and experience. Yuquot Village has been designated as
      a National Historic Site. Although we do love our history and traditional ways, it would be great to see our
       band take the chances in investing in more for our people. The business opportunities for our Mowachaht/Muchalaht
        First Nations Band is outstanding! There are so many ideas that our band could be doing with and for our people
         with all the land and knowledge we have to share and it is unfortunate that there are very few people on board
         who are willing to help make the changes we have always spoken about.

 This year we have a water taxi business (my grandfather Maximus Savey originally started this business and
 then later handed it over to our band after his retirement), Muchalaht Marina, Mathlee Forestry Company and the
 Yuquot cabin and camping accommodations. The plan for the next decade is to provide the opportunity to give the
  Mowachaht/Muchalaht band members a say in what courses/programs we would like to see happen in the future and also
   provide the work experience after completing the course/programs. Add more to the small businesses we have with the
    Muchalaht marines and Yuquot territories, for example; have skidoo, kayak and canoe rentals available, different
 types of tour guides and even a small café and gift shop out at the Cove, which could give our local artists the
chance to display their art work or even for sale if they’d like.

A children’s and youth program would also be great to have in the community; we could fundraise to
 build our own arcade at the gymnasium on Tsaxana Reserve, to go on field trips out of town. It is a great way to
 grow together as a community and have our next generations more involved in community events and our old teachings.
  It has been discussed about having a zip line going from the new reserve to the old reserve, it is still a 50/50
  debate right now, but that is not even all band members who has voted. Unfortunately, our traditional ways and
   knowledge are dying due to lack of interest in our cultures, and because of that I would love to take the first
   step in trying to get some of these things going for our Mowachaht/Muchalaht band members and our community to
   grow stronger together.
