<p>My grandmother, Catherine Mark, is an only child and her biological parents, Mac and Sophie August,
 had passed away when she was 1-year-old. Shortly after the incident, Josephine and James Skyler
 adopted her. My grandfather Eugene Mark comes from a bigger family, he has 8 siblings and his parents
  are Josephine (Nee Lucas; her maiden name before she married) and Thomas Mark. My grandparents have
  5 children, 17 grandchildren and 18 great grandchildren. Our family comes from the Ehattesaht and
  Mowachaht/Muchalaht bands, I unfortunately could not find out where my great grandparents come
  from so our family is much larger to my knowledge.
